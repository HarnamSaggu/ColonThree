# ColonThree
<br>
This is my first functioning programming language.<br>
I've wanted to create my own for a while, but I never quite got past the start, but recently I put my foot down.<br>
The language is quite poor :)<br>
Like, to add 2 numbers you cannot us '+' - you must use 'add(a, b)'.<br>
<br>
I also tried my hand at an editor for the language because notepad isn't amazing for code.<br>
I hate front-end, and so I didn't have high hopes for the design, but it came out quite well if I do say so myself.<br>
It has a 'runtime environment' included.<br>
(The code is shit, please do not burn your eyes. I probably will not refactor it on account of hating front-end.)<br>
<br>
This project has been the focus of all my attention for the past week, 7-17th July 2023.<br>
I have forgone sleep and school work for it and I do not regret any of it now my dream has been realised.<br>
I started this on the 7th using the code for lexing a past attempt.<br>
<br>
I hope to improve this to include binary operators like '+', or I may write another language.<br>
<br>
The ':3' is stupid, I was bored and I love when people use it online so...<br>
<br>
Thanks, Harnam<br>
